# Azure Serverless Workshop

This lab will provide an overview of modern cloud technologies, specifically focusing on microservice and serverless patterns and best practices on Azure. 

In this lab you will:

[Module 01: Intro](01_intro/README.md)
- Make sure you have all the prerequisites installed and get an overview of microservices and serverless technologies.

[Module 02: App Service Web App](02_app-service/README.md)
- Deploy a simple, stateless voting application using a Platform-as-a-Service.

[Module 03: Web App for Containers](03_web-app-for-containers/README.md)
- Deploy a simple, stateless voting application using a Platform-as-a-Service where you define and deploy a custom container and custom runtime.

[Module 04: Azure Container Instances](04_azure-container-instances/README.md)
- Now that you know about containers, deploy a simple, stateless voting application using a new Infrastructure-as-a-Service where containers are a first-class citizen (similar to Virtual Machines).

[Module 05: Cosmos DB](05_cosmosdb-to-aci/README.md)
- Add a reliable, scalable non-relational database backend to the voting application

[Module 06: Functions and Logic Apps](06_functions/README.md)
